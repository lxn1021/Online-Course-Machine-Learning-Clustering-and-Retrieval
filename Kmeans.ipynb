For example, if we have N data points and set K=N clusters, then we could have 0 cluster heterogeneity by setting the N centroids equal to the values of the N data points. (Note: Not all runs for larger K will result in lower heterogeneity than a single run with smaller K due to local optima.) Let's explore this general trend for ourselves by performing the following analysis."

Does this mean we should always favor a higher K? **Not at all!** As we will see in the following section, setting K too high may end up separating data points that are actually pretty alike. At the extreme, we can set individual data points to be their own clusters (K=N) and achieve zero heterogeneity, but separating each data point into its own cluster is hardly a desirable outcome. In the following section, we will learn how to detect a K set \"too large\"."
