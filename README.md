# Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval 
## --- Online Course by University of Washington, Seattle 

This repository contains the lecture slides and assginments of the Coursera online course, Machine Learning (Clustering and Retrieval), provided by University of Washington, Seattle (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/welcome). The assignments are implemented in Python Graphlab.

**Note:** The "Programming Assignment" coding framework is provided by the course, and only a few slots were inserted by students. As the professors clarified at the start, this course is by no means a programming course. I believe its main purpose is to get new starters like me an intuition of an algorithm's logic, the advantages and disadvantages of an algorithm, and when and where to use it. At this very stage, I'm still incapable of independently implementing the logics. Most of the time I just follow the codes from the course to figure them out. But once I familiarize myself with them later, I will implement the same assignments using Scikit-Learn (The course uses Graphlab).


- **Week 1 --- Welcome**

From the course: "Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there. Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform. Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients."

  - **Week 2 --- Nearest Neighbor Search**
  
  From the course: "A retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading."

  - **Week 3 --- Clustering with k-means**
  
  From the course: "In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets."

  - **Week 4 --- Mixture Models**
  
  From the course: "In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the      cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information. In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a "cluster" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via "soft assignments".
