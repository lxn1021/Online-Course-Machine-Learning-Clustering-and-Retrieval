# Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval 
## --- Online Course by University of Washington, Seattle 

This repository contains the lecture slides and assginments of the Coursera online course, Machine Learning (Clustering and Retrieval), provided by University of Washington, Seattle (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/welcome). The assignments are implemented in Python Graphlab.


- **Week 1 --- Welcome**

From the course: "Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there. Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform. Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients."
