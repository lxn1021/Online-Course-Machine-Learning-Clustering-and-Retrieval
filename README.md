# Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval 
## --- Online Course by University of Washington, Seattle 

This repository contains the lecture slides and assginments of the Coursera online course, Machine Learning (Clustering and Retrieval), provided by University of Washington, Seattle (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/welcome). The assignments are implemented in Python Graphlab.


- **Week 1 --- Welcome**

From the course: "Clustering and retrieval are some of the most high-impact machine learning tools out there. Retrieval is used in almost every applications and device we interact with, like in providing a set of products related to one a shopper is currently considering, or a list of people you might want to connect with on a social media platform. Clustering can be used to aid retrieval, but is a more broadly useful tool for automatically discovering structure in data, like uncovering groups of similar patients."

  - **Week 2 --- Nearest Neighbor Search**
  
  From the course: "A retrieval task of fetching a document similar to one someone is currently reading."

  - **Week 3 --- Clustering with k-means**
  
  From the course: "In clustering, our goal is to group the datapoints in our dataset into disjoint sets."

  - **Week 4 --- Mixture Models**
  
  From the course: "In k-means, observations are each hard-assigned to a single cluster, and these assignments are based just on the      cluster centers, rather than also incorporating shape information. In our second module on clustering, you will perform probabilistic model-based clustering that provides (1) a more descriptive notion of a "cluster" and (2) accounts for uncertainty in assignments of datapoints to clusters via "soft assignments". "

  **Memo:** Later should learn the following stuff in greater details: 1) The computation of "outer product"; 2) the computation of covariances; 3) contour plots; 4) get more comfortable with image data; 5) different kinds of statistical distributions (maybe an online course will be needed)
  
  
  - **Week 5 --- Mixed Membership Modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation**
  
  From the course: "The clustering model inherently assumes that data divide into disjoint sets, e.g., documents by topic. But, often our data objects are better described via memberships in a collection of sets, e.g., multiple topics. In our fourth module, you will explore latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an example of such a mixed membership model particularly useful in document analysis."
